Machine Learning algorithms for clustering mixed-data datasets, with focus on the qualitative variables.


**Medium post**:
How to cluster mixed sets around qualitative variables.

**This repositority is based on the follwing papers**:
* Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering - PAPER TITLE
* DBSCAN - PAPER TITLE
* K-Means - PAPER TITLE

**Intuition**:
* We consider groups of instances as single points (based on the qualitative variables values), and then cluster them.
* If you use the clusters for predictions, consider also discretizing a continuous variable so that it


Use non-gaussian mixture model to cluster the variables. For each instance, and see:
	Prob of belonging to curve A: 30%
	Prob of belonging to curve B: 50%
	Prob of belonging to curve C: 60%
	Use these as features
